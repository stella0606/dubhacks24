            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Roller coasters are not just thrilling rides; they are great examples of physics in action! Concepts like gravity, acceleration, and energy transfer come into play every time you buckle in for a ride.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts in Roller Coaster Physics</h2>
            <h3>1. Gravity</h3>
            <p>Gravity is what keeps you on the ground and pulls you down when you're at the top of a roller coaster. As you go down a hill, gravity pulls you faster!</p>

            <h3>2. Potential and Kinetic Energy</h3>
            <p>At the highest point of a roller coaster, you have maximum potential energy. As you drop down, that potential energy converts to kinetic energy, making you go faster!</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a coaster car is at a height of 50 meters, its potential energy is given by the formula:</p>
            <p><strong>Potential Energy (PE) = mass (m) × gravity (g) × height (h)</strong></p>

            <h3>3. Acceleration</h3>
            <p>Acceleration is the change in velocity. On a roller coaster, you experience rapid acceleration when you go down a drop, which adds to the thrill of the ride!</p>

            <h3>4. Centripetal Force</h3>
            <p>As you go around curves, centripetal force keeps the coaster on the track. It pulls you inward, allowing you to make those sharp turns without flying off!</p>

            <h2>Quiz Time!</h2>
            <p>If a roller coaster car with a mass of 500 kg is at the top of a 40-meter hill, what is its potential energy? (Use g = 9.8 m/s²)</p>
